    <header>
        <!-- 
            Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline. 
            This usually stays the same from one webpage to another.

    </header>
    <nav>
        <!-- 
            Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs. 
            Like the header, this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another
         -->
    </nav>
    <main>
        <!-- 
            A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage, for example, the video you want to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news headlines, etc. 
            This is the one part of the website that definitely will vary from page to page!
         -->
        <section>
            <div class="hero">
                <h2>A non-revolutionary web app for storing your (oddly-specific) .wav files...</h2>

    <footer>
        <!-- 
            A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info.
            It's a place to put common information (like the header) but usually, that information is not critical or secondary to the website itself. 
            The footer is also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content.
